Apart from regular work, I go to a lot of conferences, meetings, hackathons, and alike, for inspiration and knowledge. At some point I started giving talks and leading workshops myself. Each talk requires a lot of research, so it helps me to get better, while helping others as well. Pure win-win situation. 

So far I've given 103 talks. Not bad for a hobby. Below you will find some of them.

### With a little help from my friends: architecture in a group of anarchists

So if you already have an Architecture Guild (see "Common mistakes" talk), how do you actually grow your soft skills? As a nerd. Lots of books and thoughts on that matter.

### Common mistakes when moving to microservices

Since I help enterprises move to microservice based architecture, I've noticed some common mistakes and I've learned how to fix them

### Improving your Test Driven Development in 45 minutes 

I use TDD since 2005, and I've been teaching BDD/TDD for several years now, so I have a few tricks I can share
